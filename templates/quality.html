	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <p>The data set presented in this site is about dog bite injuries. The data was provided by a legal firm, and is a collection of 
        injury statistics associated with breeds of dogs that span from 1982 to 2012. For the most part, the data is good quality, although there are
        some missing datum.
        </p>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<p> The data was not entirely complete. Some categories of injuries associated with a certain breed were missing or blank. This did not raise
	much concern, as there were not many columns that had missing data. To account for this, I only plotted non-zero statistics for each breed of dog.
	</p>
	<p>If not, what is missing and what concerns does it raise?
	What is your evidence for this?</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<p>Does it make sense relative to itself? Does it match your
	expectations? Are the distributions sensible? What is your
	evidence for this?</p>
		The data is pretty coherent in my opinion. I am not an expert in animals, but the data does seem to match my expectations, in that there
		would be breeds of dogs that seem to be more aggressive than others. This is evident in the fact that certain breeds, like the pitbull, have
		more counts of attacks than others, and it skews.
      </div>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<p>What aspects of this data can you verify? How did you do so? What did
	you find?</p>
		The data is correct, as it comes from a legal source.
